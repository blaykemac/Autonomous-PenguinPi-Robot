# ECE4078_Lab_2021
Repository for labs of unit ECE4078 (Intelligent Robotics) offered in 2021

You will work in groups to develop a fruit delivery robot. The groups will be assigned based on your answers to the CATME survey. More info about the lab project can be found on [Moodle](https://lms.monash.edu/course/view.php?id=111695&section=3).

For each milestone, you will need to submit your implementation on Moodle before your lab session in the following week, and perform a live demonstration during the lab session in the following week. For example, M1's submission and live demo will be in week 3.

Working with the physical robot is optional and the assessments will be simulator-based. The lab sessions are hybrid. If you are coming in-person, please bring your own laptop and a headset so that you can join the Zoom sessions if needed. Please check your Moodle for information on which lab session you belong to.
